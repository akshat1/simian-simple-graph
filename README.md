# Simian Simple Graph

This is a pretty basic DAG structure I cooked up for a particular project (and later expanded on). You are provided two constructors, `Graph` and `Edge`. Both `Graph` and `Edge` are immutable. `Graph` contains an immutable set of `Edge` objects. `Edge` contains two strings, `from` and `to`. The nodes in the graph are always strings, which lets us simplify caching results of various operations. To associate more data with a node, you can either keep data for each node in a `Map`, or have each node-item have an id, which is what you will store in the `Graph`.

There are a handful of common `Graph` operations implemented as static methods on the Graph class, and hopefully those will be enough to enable more advanced use.

Note that children / edges of a node are not stored in order (because we use a Set internally). This would normally preclude inorder / preorder / postorder traversal of the tree. However, our two tree walking functions (`Graph.depthFirst()` and `Graph.breadthFirst()`) let you supply sort functions which can enable such ordered traversal.

Please feel free to log bugs / feature-requests in github. Docs can be generated by checking out the repo and running `npm run doc`, followed by opening `docs/index.html`.

## Installation
```
npm i --save simian-simple-graph
```

## Usage
```js
import * as SSG from 'simian-simple-graph';

const {
  Graph,
  Edge
} = SSG;

const g0 = new Graph([
  new Edge('a', 'b'), // a -> b
  new Edge('a', 'c'), // a -> c
  new Edge('a', 'd'), // a -> d
  new Edge('d', 'e'), // d -> e
  new Edge('d', 'f'), // d -> f
]);

const g1 = Graph.getSubTree(g0, 'd'); // d -> e, d -> f
```
